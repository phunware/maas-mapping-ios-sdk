## 2.5.1 (Thursday, Jul 20th, 2015)
* Added ability for developer to control whether or not the maneuver change is animated. See `- (BOOL)mapViewShouldAnimateAutomaticRouteManeuverChange:(PWMapView *)mapView` delegate method.
* Added new method to PWMapView, `-(void)setRouteManever:(PWRouteManever *)maneuver animated:(BOOL)animated` that allows you to control whether or no the maneuver is animated when switching.

  **NOTE**: The old method, `-(void)setRouteManever:(PWRouteManever *)maneuver` no longer animates the maneuver change.

* Added property to `PWDirectionsOptions` called `excludedPointIdentifiers`. Specify an array of point identifiers that you would like to exclude from routing. Please see `PWDirectionsOptions` header for more information.
* Fixed an issue where automatic maneuver switching would not work with the GPS location provider if the floor identifier was unknown. Now switches the to closest maneuver on a given floor.
* Fixed an issue where toggling the zoom workaround on/off would no longer preserve the center position.
* Instrumented SDK with mapping & navigation analytics. Analytics are disabled by default. See `PWMapKitAnalytics` for more information and to enable.

* Updating zoom workaround to with iOS 8.4 and all subsequent iOS 8 versions. Note that the zoom workaround will not work on iOS 9 since iOS 9 resolves the issue.

## 2.5.0 (Thursday, June 4th, 2015)
* Added support for turn-by-turn directions. Turn-by-turn maneuvers can be accessed by accessing the `maneuvers` property on a `PWRoute` object. You can plot a route maneuver on a `PWMapView` intance by calling `setRouteManeuver:` with a valid `PWRouteManeuver` object. All previous route behavior is still present and unaffected. Please see the turn-by-turn sample as an example of how to implement turn-by-turn.

  **NOTE**: You will need to plot a route maneuever in order to enter turn-by-turn mode.

* Route maneuvers switch automatically when location upates are available and the indoor user tracking mode is set to `PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollow` or `PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading`. You can manually set route maneuvers if desired but that will set the indoor user tracking mode to `PWIndoorUserTrackingModeNone`.
* Added new class, `PWRouteManeuever`. A route maneuver encapsulates information related to given maneuver such as turn direction, distance and other information.
* Route steps are now automatically selected by the SDK in response to user initiated floor changes or location updates. A new callback has been created when a route step changes.
* Added `PWMapView` delegate callback `mapView:didChangeRouteStep:`. This method is called whenever the `PWRouteStep` being displayed by the map view changes.
* Added `PWMapView` delegate callback `mapView:didChangeRouteManeuver:`. This method is called whenever the `PWRouteManeuver` being displayed by the map changes.
* Routing and maneuver overlays now use the `mapView.tintColor` property when rendering their overlays.
* When registering a `PWGPSLocationManager` with the map view the location will now show on all floors regardless of whether or not there is a valid `floorIDMapping` match.

## 2.5.0 - BETA 1 (Friday, May 15th, 2015)
* Beta release of turn-by-turn features

## 2.4.1 (Monday, Apr 27th, 2015)
* Fixed issue where `didFailToLoadBuilding:` was not being called while in airplane mode on initial launch with no cached data.
* Fixed a memory issue where route steps and segments were not being released when destroying a `PWMapView` instance.
* Fixed issue where `PWMapView` delegate method `mapView:didChangeIndoorUserTrackingMode:` would not be called in certain instance.
* Fixed regression which made `PWBuildingAnnotationView` hard to tap.
* Added horizontal accuracy bubble to indoor blue dot view.
* Added discreet sample apps for Pin Drop, Zoom Workaround, POI Management

## 2.4.0 (Friday, Mar 13th, 2015)
* Added the ability to enable and disable annotation zoom levels. See the `annotationZoomLevelsEnabled` property on `PWMapView` for more information.
* Added the ability for users to add and remove `PWBuildingAnnotation` objects to and from the map view. NOTE: When adding or removing annotations, only `annotationID` equality will be checked.
* Fixed a bug where inaccessible routes were sometimes returned for accessible-only requests.
* Fixed a bug where routing between two points on the same floor would sometimes return a route that spanned multiple floors.
* Fixed a bug where setting `showsIndoorUserLocation` on `PWMapView to ‘NO’ would not hide the blue dot.
* Fixed a bug where toggling route snapping tolerance would not resume route snapping when reenabled.
* Added the ability to stop loading a building. See `stopLoadingBuilding` method on `PWMapView` for more information.
* Fixed a bug where memory for the routing graph wasn't being released when the `PWMapView` instance was being deallocated.
* Fixed a bug where building assets would get ‘stuck’ while the user’s blue dot continued to move during a route across multiple floors (with a valid indoor location).
* Added a flag to `PWBuildingAnnotationProtocol`, `occlusionEnabled`. This flag determines whether the annotation label for a given annotation will be occluded by other labels. If `occlusionEnabled` is set to `NO`, the annotation label will **always** be visible.
* `PWMapView` now correctly calls the delegate callback ` -mapView:didChangeIndoorUserTrackingMode:`.
* Added options that allow routing from any point of interest, user location or dropped pin annotation to any other point of interest, user location or dropped pin annotation (in other words, any type of route endpoint is now allowed on either end of the route). See `PWDirections` and `PWDirectionsWaypointProtocol` for more information.
* Enhanced routing functionality now uses a synchronous directions request interface. The former asynchronous request/response model is still supported but will be deprecated.
* Renamed `PWBuildingOverlayDelegate` to `PWBuildingOverlayDelegateProtocol`.
* Deprecated the old indoor location manager registration interface in favor of a more simply named method with accompanying unregister method.
* Removed the `-setCurrentFloor:` PWMapView property mutator declaration and removed the `readonly` attribute of the property.

## 2.3.1 (Monday, Mar 2nd, 2015)
* Fixed bug where when routing across multiple floors with a valid indoor location the build asset would get 'stuck' while the blue dot continued to move.
* Updated `PWRouteOverlayRenderer` initializer to accept a building overlay as part of initialization: `- (instancetype)initWithRouteOverlay:(PWRouteOverlay *)overlay buildingOverlay:(PWBuildingOverlay *)buildingOverlay`

## 2.3.0 (Thursday, Jan 29th, 2015)
* Added new "blue dot smoothing" functionality to provide a better user location tracking experience.
* Added `blueDotSmoothingEnabled` boolean property to `PWMapView` for turning blue dot smoothing on and off.
* Added `routeSnappingTolerance` enumeration property to `PWMapView` for turning off route snapping or setting a different tolerance.
* Added a **temporary** iOS 8 mapping zoom level workaround that will be removed as soon as Apple fixes their zoom level inadequacies.  Using the zoom level is explicit (not based on user-specified zoom scale) and is changed using the `-toggleZoomWorkaround` method.  The property `isUsingZoomWorkaround` indicates the current state of use of this workaround.  When in use, the workaround draws building assets at 4x their usual size and points of interest are repositioned accordingly.
* Added KVO notifications to the `PWMapView` property `indoorUserTrackingMode`.
* Added a `buildingAnnotations` property on `PWMapView` that contains all points of interest for the current building.
* Added `showBuildingAnnotation:animated:` method that focuses the map view to the provided annotation with optional animation. NOTE: This method will not work for object copies of POIs obtained from the building manager or elsewhere.  In order to find an annotation by identifier, name, or other property, simply search the `buildingAnnotations` property.  This method will automatically change floors on the map if necessary.  It will also zoom in to the maximum zoom level.
* `PWMapView` now honors the `maxZoomLevel` parameter for `PWBuildingAnnotation` objects
* You no longer need to manage the annotation image at the application level. `PWBuildingAnnotationView` now manages caching and loading of the annotation image internally.
* Building floors are now ordered in ascending order based on the `floorLevel` value.
* The `PWMapView` now only loads annotations for the current floor. The previous behavior was to load all building annotations and show/hide as necessary. `mapView.annotations` will now only return annotations for the current floor. If you would like to use all building annotations please use the `buildingAnnotations` property.
* You can now switch to `PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollowWithHeading` while in routing mode. Note that the default indoor user tracking mode is still `PWIndoorUserTrackingModeFollow`.
* Consolidated all cached mapping data into one cache directory under `Library/Caches`.
* Mapping data cache expiration bumped to 24 hours. It was previously incorrectly set to 1.75 hours.
* Cleaned up public interfaces, removing extraneous and non-functional methods.
* Floor change no longer breaks the current indoor user tracking mode. See Wiki for additional details on user tracking behavior.
* Many bug fixes and performance enhancements
* Small updates to sample code
