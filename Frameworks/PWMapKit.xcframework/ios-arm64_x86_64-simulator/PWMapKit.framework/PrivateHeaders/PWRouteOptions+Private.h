// APENDLEY: Currently the `visualImpairedEnabled` property is not completely exposed to customers. They can set this flag on POIs/Waypoints,
// however currently the SDK does not provide a way to filter out 'visualImpaired' points when routing. When we do officially
// provide it, we should then make this flag publicly available.
