 The `PWDirectionsResponse` class provides a container for route information returned by the Phunware servers. You do not create instances of this class directly. Instead, you can initiate a request for directions between two points by calling the calculateDirectionsWithCompletionHandler: method of a PWDirections object. You will receive an instance of this class as the result.

 An array of route objects representing the directions between the start and end points. (read-only)
 @discussion The array contains one or more `PWRoute` objects, each of which represents a possible set of directions for the user to follow. If you did not request alternate routes in the original directions request, this array contains at most one object.
 
 Each route object contains geometry information that you can use to display that route in your appâ€™s map view.
