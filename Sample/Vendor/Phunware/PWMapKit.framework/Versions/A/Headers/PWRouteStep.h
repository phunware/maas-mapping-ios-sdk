 A `PWRouteStep` object represents one part of an overall route. Each step in a route corresponds to a single instruction that would need to be followed by the user.
 
 You do not create instances of this class directly. Instead, you can receive route steps as part of an overall PWRoute object when you request directions. For more information about requesting directions, see `PWDirections`.
