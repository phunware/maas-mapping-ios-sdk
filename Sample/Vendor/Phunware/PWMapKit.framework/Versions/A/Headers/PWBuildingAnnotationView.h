/**
 The `PWAnnotationView` class is responsible for presenting building annotations visually in a map view. Annotation views are loosely coupled to a corresponding building annotation object that corresponds to the `PWBuildingAnnotation` protocol. When an annotationâ€™s coordinate point is in the visible region, the map view asks its delegate to provide a corresponding annotation view. Annotation views may be recycled later and put into a reuse queue that is maintained by the map view.

 Initializes and returns a new annotation view.
 @param annotation The building annotation object to associate with the new view.
 @param reuseIdentifier If you plan to reuse the annotation view for similar types of annotations, pass a string to identify it. Although you can pass `nil` if you do not intend to reuse the view, reusing annotation views is generally recommended.
 @return The initialized building annotation view or nil if there was a problem initializing the object.
