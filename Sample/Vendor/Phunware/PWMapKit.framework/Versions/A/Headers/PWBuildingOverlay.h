 The `PWMapViewDelegate` protocol defines a set of optional methods that you can use to receive building-related update messages. Because many map operations require the `PWMapView` class to load data asynchronously, the map view calls these methods to notify your application when specific operations complete.
 
 Before releasing a `PWMapView` object for which you have set a delegate, remember to set that objectâ€™s delegate property to `nil`.
