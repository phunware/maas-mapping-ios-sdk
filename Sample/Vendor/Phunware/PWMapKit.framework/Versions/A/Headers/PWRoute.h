/**
 The `PWRoute` class defines a single route that the user can follow between a requested start and end point. The route object defines the geometry for the route and includes information you can display to the user in association with that route, such as the name of the route, its distance and the expected travel time.
 
 You do not create instances of this class directly. Instead, you receive route objects when you request directions. For more information about requesting directions, see `PWDirections` Class Reference.
