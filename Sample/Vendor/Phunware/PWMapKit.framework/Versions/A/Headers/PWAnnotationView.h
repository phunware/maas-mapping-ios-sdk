 The annotation object currently associated with the view.
 @discussion You should not change the value of this property directly. This property contains a non-nil value only while the annotation view is visible on the map. If the view is queued and waiting to be reused, the value is nil.

 The offset (in point) at which to display the view.
 @discussion By default, the center point of an annotation view is placed at the coordinate point of the associated annotation. You can use this property to reposition the annotation view as needed. These x and y offset values are measured in point. Positive offset values move the annotation view down and to the right, while negative values move it up and to the left.

/**
 The string that identifies that this annotation view is reusable.
 @discussion You specify the reuse identifier when you create the view. Use this type later to retrieve an annotation view that was created previously but which is currently unused because its annotation is not on screen.
 
 If you define distinctly different types of annotations (with distinctly different annotation views to go with them), you can differentiate between the annotation types by specifying different reuse identifiers for each one.

/**
 Initializes and returns a new annotation view.
 @param frame The frame of the annotation view.
 @param annotation The annotation object to associate with the new view.
 @param reuseIdentifier If you plan to reuse the annotation view for similar types of annotations, pass a string to identify it. Although you can pass nil if you do not intend to reuse the view, reusing annotation views is generally recommended.
 @return The initialized annotation view or nil if there was a problem initializing the object.
 @discussion The reuse identifier provides a way for you to improve performance by recycling annotation views as they are scrolled on and off of the map. As views are no longer needed, they are moved to a reuse queue by the map view. When a new annotation becomes visible, your application can request a view for that annotation by passing the appropriate reuse identifier string to the dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifier: method of PWMapView.
